Pros:
- Optimized integrations with AWS services:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/connect-supported-services.html
The lambdas and ECS tasks do not need to be aware of the pipeline they are part of.
- Support for the sync and async lambda executions.
- Support for the sync executions of the ECS service.


Cons:

- Does not build the execution graph as e.g. the circleci (with 'require' tags). Instead, the next
execution step must be specified explicitly.

- ECS task requires passing the configuration - that is a lot of information

- It is not possible to pass values back to the pipeline from an ECS task without using .waitForTaskToken
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/connect-to-resource.html#connect-wait-token) that makes
the ECS task pipeline-aware
